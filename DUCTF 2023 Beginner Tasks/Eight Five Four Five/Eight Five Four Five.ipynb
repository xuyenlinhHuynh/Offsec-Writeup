    "For blockchain challenge, you definitely can solve completely with JavaScript or Python (import relevant blockchain library). However, as a beginner in this type of challenge, I spent 2 hours to learn the basic way of solving blockchain contract using these two applications: **MetaMask** and **Remix IDE**. In this writeup, I will go through the way I set up the challenge-solving environment, as well as explaining how I write the attack (solving) contract in a *super beginner-friendly* way üëÄ\n",
    "\n",
    "A very first step is to setup the challenge website which gives me an account to connect to the DUCTF blockchain network. On the DUCTF site, click on the challenge and start the environment, there will be a link prompting to the setup account and RPC URL to the network that I can use.\n",

    "Accessing the website will give me all the details including my account (*Balance and Private Key*), the blockchain infrastructure connection (*RPC URL*) and the actual contract address.

    "The next step would be to connect to the DUCTF blockchain network (infrastructure). I use **MetaMask** to connect to the network and to manage my account. You can find **MetaMask** as an extension of Chrome or Firefox, then sign up an account for that. By default, it will connect to the **Ethereum Mainnet**. Then everytime coming back to the extension, I can unlock the account by password authentication.\n",

    "There is no DUCTF network available by default so I have to manually **add network**. I have to fill in all the required details taken from the DUCTF blockchain website for the network connection. The warning is just alerting about untrusted network... But this is a CTF so nevermind.\n",

On the top-centre option of the interface, click on the **Account** which prompts to a drop-down box. From there, click **Import account**. DUCTF already registered an account for player having balance to transact payment to the blockchain solving process. So, importing the account then I am ready to roll üòé\n",

The private key could also be taken from the DUCTF challenge website above. *Note that each time we start or reset a new session, the private key and contract address might change*. So, if I restart the challenge, I will need to import the new account again. Also, I have to make sure that the session is on during the challenge solving process as well as to maintain the connection to the DUCTF network.\n",

    "Next step I will use **Remix IDE** to write and compile the attack contract. I have to upload the original contract given by DUCTF \"**EightFiveFourFive.sol**\", and create a new *.sol* file for my attack which I save it as \"**test.sol**\". \n",

    "\n",

    "Then, I briefly analyse the given source code (contract). Basically, the task is to make sure the function \"**isSolved()**\" returns the boolean with the value \"**true**\". The variable that \"**isSolved()**\" returns is \"**you_solved_it**\" being originally set to \"**false**\", so directly calling the function \"**isSolved()**\" would not solve the challenge. This beginner task is somehow more difficult than the DUCTF 2022 beginner blockchain challenge. But, with the foundational knowledge of programming, I treat the *contract* as *class* in Java with \"**constructor**\" and \"**function**\". So, later on I just have to pass the same parameter to the \"**constructor**\" and the *function* \"**solve_the_challenge**\" which will return \"**true**\" to the variable \"**you_solved_it**\". Then, simply calling \"**isSolved()**\" will return \"**true**\". Challenge done ‚úÖ\n",

    "However, a very clear warning shows that my compiler cannot be compatible with the *solidity version 0.8.19*. So on the left-hand side of the interface, clicking the third icon will lead me to the compiler of the IDE. I can see the current compiler (set to default) is **0.8.18**.\n",

    "<img src=\"Screenshots/8545 11.png\" alt=\"compiler\" width=\"300\"/>\n",

    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Next step is to create my attack file. I use the same file extension *.sol* as the original contract, and the same compiler version. Then, I import the original contract as an interface to my attack contract. If you wish, you can instead add an \"**import**\" statement as in *Python* or *JavaScript* then create an *object* of the original contract in the attack contract. The interface will have both external functions from the original contract. *Note that in the attack contract, I can only use function or variable that is public or external denoted in the original contract*. So, I cannot directly access the \"**use_this**\" string since it was set to be private. Therefore, I have to access this string via the \"**readTheStringHere**\" function. Also, I need the function \"**solve_the_challenge**\" to change the value of \"**you_solved_it**\". That is why I include these two functions in the defined interface. Come to the constructor of the attack contract, I create an address variable holding the **contract address** given by the DUCTF website which is used to construct the *EightFiveFourFive* contract. Then, inside the constructor, I call the function \"**solve_the_challenge**\" with the parameter as the \"**use_this**\" string returned by the function \"**readTheStringHere**\". Therefore, the \"**you_solved_it**\" will return \"**true**\". By this step, my attack contract has been completed.\n",
