    "The challenge is very straight-forward. After joining the Discord server of DownUnderCTF, I start looking around in the channel \"rules\", there is a roughly 4 minute video in the channel talking about *monkey support*. It sounds silly but according to the challenge name, I can guess this video may contain the flag. So, this is a meme task ðŸ˜‚.\n",

    "Back to the rule of DownUnderCTF, our flag has to start with DUCTF. In the above image we can see the initials of the first five words before \"**{**\" corresponding to \"**DUCTF**\", so the initials of the rest in this meme will make up the actual flag value. "
